# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The Team Profile Generator is a Node.js application designed to generate an HTML page containing profiles for a software development team. It utilizes user input through the command line to gather information about team members and then dynamically generates an HTML page to showcase their profiles. The application also incorporates Jest for testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.

## Features

- **User-friendly Command Line Interface:** The application prompts the user to input information about team members, including their roles, names, IDs, emails, and specific role-related information.

- **HTML Page Generation:** Once the user has provided all necessary information, the application dynamically generates an HTML page that displays profiles for each team member. The HTML page is structured to be easily readable and visually appealing.
- **Multiple Team Member Roles:** The application supports different roles such as Manager, Engineer, and Intern, with role-specific information being collected during the user input process.
- **Jest Testing:** Jest is integrated into the project for automated testing. This ensures that the application functions correctly, and any future changes or additions to the codebase can be confidently implemented without breaking existing functionality.
